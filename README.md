# PUI_HW_8
 
- The files contained in this respository are for Programming Usable Interactions (PUI), homework assignment 8.
- The file named "PUI-Assignment-8.pdf" is the official write-up for this homework.
- I want to acknowledge that in order to complete this project, I relied heavily on the wonderfully clear conventions set forth by Lewy Blue in his web book, *Discovering Three.js*, located here: https://discoverthreejs.com/ . Having said that I have attempted to take those conventions and make my own variation of those building blocks and best practices. As I searched for resources to learn Three.js I found nothing clearer, and more well-thought out than Lewy's tutorials.
